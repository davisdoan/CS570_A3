This assignment contains the following files, README.txt file, a header file called header.h and my main program called main.c. Our main program is the parent process for the threads that will be running, handling the creation and joining of the threads. Makefile includes a script to allow you to call it to compile and run the program greatly reducing repetitive command line arguments. QUOTE.txt will contain all of the printed output done by the threads.

header.h -- header
main.c --- main program
makefile -- makefile
QUOTE.txt -- output file.

To Run this program call
